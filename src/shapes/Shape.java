//    Exercises
//    Create an abstract Shape class inside of the shapes directory.
//
//    Inside of shapes, create an abstract Quadrilateral class that extends Shape and implements Measurable. This class should have:
//
//    protected properties for length and width
//    a constructor that accepts two numbers for the length and width and sets those properties
//    methods for getting the length and width
//    abstract methods for setting the length and width
//    Change your existing Rectangle class to inherit from Quadrilateral and implement Measurable.
//
//    IntelliJ can automatically create the skeleton of all the methods that need to be implemented.
//
//    Change your existing Square class to extend Quadrilateral.
//
//    Because the length of all sides of a square are the same, the methods for setting the length and the width should set both protected properties.
//
//    Modify your ShapesTest class, use it to:
//
//    declare a variable of the type Measurable named myShape.
//    Test your code by creating instances of both Square and Rectangle and assigning them to myShape so you can display the shape's area and circumference.
//
//    Answer the following questions:
//
//    Why does the code fail to compile if you leave off the getPerimeter method in Rectangle?
//
//    What happens if you try to call the getLength or getWidth methods of the myShape variable? Why?
